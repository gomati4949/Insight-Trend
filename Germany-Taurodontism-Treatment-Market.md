This category includes the use of braces, aligners, and other orthodontic devices aimed at correcting the alignment of the teeth and jaw. Orthodontic treatments for taurodontism focus on improving bite functionality, ensuring that the teeth align properly despite the abnormal root formation. With the rising awareness of cosmetic dentistry and dental health, there is an increasing demand for orthodontic solutions that provide both aesthetic and functional benefits to patients.
